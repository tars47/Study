1) what is lexical scoping?

2) what is nodejs architecture?

3) explain the event loop

4) what is the output of the following code
   function y() {
      console.log(1);
      setTimeout(() => {
         console.log(2);
      }, 0);
      new Promise(resolve => {
         console.log(3);
         resolve(4);
         console.log(5);
      });
      new Promise(resolve => resolve(6)).then(console.log);
      console.log(7);
    }
